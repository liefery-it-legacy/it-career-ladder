# Principal Developer

Principal Developer is a technical leadership role, without people management
responsibilities. This means that you are responsible for technical initiatives
and you will be influencing your peers indirectly - by acting as a role model,
sharing your knowledge, mentoring, and getting people on board by the power of
arguments.

The promotion to this role is opportunity-limited. This means that in order to
get promoted you need to possess the necessary skills and there has to be
a need for a technical leader in the team.
